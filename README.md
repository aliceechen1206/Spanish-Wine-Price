The barplot comparing the rating and price shows that the wine priced at 600 the average rating is 4.9. The second graph shows the types of wine compared to the price. The majority of the type of wine is the Toro Red and Priorat Red which the price is around $200.


**Recommendations:**
PCA KNN model would be the better choice as the allowed us to predict the average price of the wine is about $57. The cheaper wine rating are lower than the pricer wine although is still rated 4 out of 5
