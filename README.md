Comparing the ratings of the wine to the price

The barplot comparing the rating and price shows that the wine priced at 600 the average rating is 4.9. The second graph shows the types of wine compared to the price. The majority of the type of wine is the Toro Red and Priorat Red which the price is around $200.


**Recommendations:**
I recommend using the regression tree because the R2 in the decision tree is negative and we should not get a negative on that value as it means that there is something wrong with the model.
