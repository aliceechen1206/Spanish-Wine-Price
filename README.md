**Business problem:**
Popularity and wine type affect the price of wine. We will provide the suggested price for each bottle based on the type of wine and the rating.


**Methods**
The dataset that will be used contains more than 7000 different types of red wines from Spain with 11 features that describe their origin, price, and rating. Using Barplot, Seaborn, PCA KNN, Pandas and Numpy for exploration of relationship between groups and predict the pricing for each wine.

**Results**

Comparing types of wine to the price

The barplot comparing the rating and price shows that the wine priced at 600 the average rating is 4.9. The second graph shows the types of wine compared to the price. The majority of the type of wine is the Toro Red and Priorat Red which the price is around $200.


**Recommendations:**
The model shows better result when it is priced below $500. Since there are wines that are over $500 to get the best result, it would be best to find a dataset model to fit the expensive wines.
